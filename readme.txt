This plugin displays DonorsChoose.org projects in the vicinity of the user (based on their IP address).

== Description ==

[DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org "DonorsChoose") is an online charity that makes it easy for anyone to help students in need. Â 
The DonorsChoose Projects Near Me Wordpress plugin does more than allow blog publishers to display DonorsChoose projects on their site: 
it estimates the blog viewer's physical location (via their IP address) and then displays projects that are in close proximity.

This plugin can be used via the `donorschoose` shortcode or via the included widget.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `donorschooseme` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Use the DonorsChoose Me widget or place `[donorschooseme]` in the body or a post or page.
1. You will need to get your own [DonorsChoose.org API key](http://developer.donorschoose.org/help-contact#TOC-Request-a-key) and enter it on the plugins settings page (Settings -> DonorsChoose Me). Note: If you are just testing out the plugin, you can use the API key: DONORSCHOOSE.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the plugin look un-styled =

The plugin has minimal styling so that it can be adapted to your theme.  The plugin automatically includes the *very* basic dcm_style.css style sheet.

= The projects listed are not physically near my users =

When a user visits your site the plugin looks at their IP address and checks it against a [free database service](http://www.geoplugin.com/webservices/php) to see where that IP address is located.
Mistakes can be made and some IP databases are not 100% accurate.

In the worst case scenario of an IP address not being geolocated, the plugin returns projects near Mt. Pleasant, Iowa (my hometown).
